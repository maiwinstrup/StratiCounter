To create a shared library, run the command from the root of StratiCounter:

mcc -W lib:straticounter -T link:lib -d out -v straticounter.m

This will create a shared object file along with a C source and C header in the
out/ directory. Right now, the main routine takes no arguments and uses a hard-coded
set of parameters. From what I can tell, when the top-level function takes an argument,
then the types of those parameters are of a type mxArray, which appears to be the general
Matlab C datastructure.

Matlab supplies a builtin function that will test whether or not the code is
running in a deployed environment (i.e. a compiled shared object, as opposed to
in the interpreter).  This function is called `isdeployed`. This is used as a
guard around code sections which are not supported, and uneeded, by the
compiler. Example:

if ~isdeployed
    addpath(genpath('./Subroutines'))
    addpath(genpath('./Settings'))
end

Indeed, most, if not all, of the plotting should be guarded. So it is not
called in the compiled form.


Finally, the shared object will need to loaded by Python at runtime and the C
function called. There may be the need to add another wrapper around the shared
object for when parameters are passed to it. This is to translate between the
python PyObject type to the mxMatrix type.
